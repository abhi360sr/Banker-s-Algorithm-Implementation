# Banker-s-Algorithm-Implementation

Certainly! Here is a sample README file for the given code:

This repository contains a C program that implements the Banker's Algorithm for resource allocation and deadlock avoidance in operating systems. The program checks whether the system is in a safe state by simulating process execution based on resource requests.

## Introduction

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources and then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

## Features

- Input the number of processes and resource types.
- Input the available resources, allocated resources, and maximum required resources.
- Calculate the need matrix.
- Check if the system is in a safe state.
- Handle resource requests from processes dynamically.
- Determine and display the safe sequence of process execution if the system is in a safe state.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bankers-algorithm.git
    cd bankers-algorithm
    ```

2. **Compile the Program**

    ```sh
    gcc bankers_algorithm.c -o bankers_algorithm
    ```

3. **Run the Program**

    ```sh
    ./bankers_algorithm
    ```

4. **Input Details**

    - Number of processes.
    - Number of resource types.
    - Instances of each resource available.
    - Allocated resources for each process.
    - Maximum required resources for each process.

5. **Dynamic Requests**

    - The program will prompt for new resource requests from processes.
    - Input 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if any process has a new resource request.
    - If 'yes', input the process number and the requested resources.

## Example

### Sample Input

```
Enter the number of processes: 5

Enter the number of resources: 3

Enter the number of instances of each resource (current available): 
For resource 0: 3
For resource 1: 3
For resource 2: 2

For process (p0): 
Allocated Resource 0: 0
Allocated Resource 1: 1
Allocated Resource 2: 0

...

For process (p4): 
Allocated Resource 0: 0
Allocated Resource 1: 0
Allocated Resource 2: 2

Allocation Matrix:
  0   1   0 
  2   0   0 
  3   0   2 
  2   1   1 
  0   0   2 

For process (p0): 
Max Resource 0: 7
Max Resource 1: 5
Max Resource 2: 3

...

For process (p4): 
Max Resource 0: 4
Max Resource 1: 3
Max Resource 2: 3

Max matrix:
  7   5   3 
  3   2   2 
  9   0   2 
  2   2   2 
  4   3   3 

Need matrix:
  7   4   3 
  1   2   2 
  6   0   0 
  0   1   1 
  4   3   1 
```

### Sample Output

```
Safe sequence: 1 3 4 0 2
```

### Resource Request Example

```
Does any process have any request? (yes/no) yes

Process no: 1
Resource new request 0: 1
Resource new request 1: 0
Resource new request 2: 2

Need matrix:
  7   4   3 
  0   2   0 
  6   0   0 
  0   1   1 
  4   3   1 

Safe sequence: 1 3 4 0 2

Does any process have any request? (yes/no) no
```
